== About me
I am a final-year PhD student at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rogerz/ Roger Zimmermann] and Prof. [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~david/index.html David S. Rosenblum]. I have published over 30 papers in refereed journals and conferences (with 1.5K+ citations), such as TKDE, KDD, NeurIPS, WWW, CVPR, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, MM and UbiComp. I also serve as a PC member (reviewer) for several top-tier conferences, e.g., KDD, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, WWW, ECCV, IJCAI and AAAI. Thanks to the supervision of Prof. [http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng Yu Zheng] and Dr. [https://zhangjunbo.org/ Junbo Zhang], I started my research career at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and graduated from Xidian University. I have been recognized as 1 out of 10 most innovative and impactful PhD students focusing on Data Science in Singapore by the Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) in 2020.

I am currently seeking for job opportunities in both academia and industry. If you are interested in my research or hiring me, please feel free to contact me.
