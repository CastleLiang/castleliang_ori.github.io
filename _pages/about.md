I am a final-year PhD student at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz) and Prof. [David S. Rosenblum](https://cs.gmu.edu/~dsr). Thanks to the supervision of Prof. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and Dr. [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org), I started my research career at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) (MSRA) and graduated from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/). I have published ~40 papers in refereed journals and conferences, such as TKDE, KDD, NeurIPS, WWW, ECCV, IJCAI, AAAI, MM and UbiComp. According to Google Scholar, my publications have collectively gathered 1,700+ citations, with h-index of 19 and i10-index of 28. Among them, three papers ([GeoMAN](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0476.pdf), [ST-MetaNet](http://urban-computing.com/pdf/kdd_2019_camera_ready_ST_MetaNet.pdf) and [STMTMVL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ijcai16-Zheng-water-quality.pdf)) were selected as the most influential IJCAI/KDD papers according to [PaperDigest](https://www.paperdigest.org/2022/02/most-influential-ijcai-papers-2022-02/), which indicates their significant impacts on both industry and academia. I also serve as a PC member (reviewer) for some top-tier conferences, including KDD, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, WWW, CVPR, ECCV, IJCAI and AAAI. 

I have been recognized as 1 out of 10 most innovative and impactful PhD students focusing on Data Science in Singapore by Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) in 2020. My research interests mainly lie in
- **Spatio-temporal (ST) data mining**: ST representation learning, time series forecasting, ST imputation, AI for social good (e.g., transportation, human mobility, environment, climate), physics-informed learning.
- **Graph mining**: learning graph representations (e.g., directed graphs, temporal graphs), GNN pruning.
- **Computer vision**: video understanding, image recognition, image/video super-resolution, geo-localization.

I am currently seeking for job opportunities in both academia and industry. If you are interested in my research or hiring me, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!
