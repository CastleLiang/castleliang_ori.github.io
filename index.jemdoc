== About me
I am a third-year PhD student at School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rogerz/ Roger Zimmermann] and Prof. [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~david/index.html David S. Rosenblum]. I have published some papers in refereed journals and conferences (with 800+ citations), such as TKDE, KDD, NeurIPS, WWW, IJCAI, AAAI, MM and UbiComp. I also serve as a PC member (reviewer) for several top-tier conferences, e.g., KDD, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, AAAI and ECML-PKDD. Thanks to the supervision of Prof. [http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng Yu Zheng] and Dr. [https://zhangjunbo.org/ Junbo Zhang], I started my research career at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and graduated from Xidian University. My research interests lie in Spatio-Temporal Data Mining, Urban Computing and Graph Learning.
